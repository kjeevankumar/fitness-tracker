# 🔥 Fitness Calorie Burn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity using supervised machine learning algorithms. It serves as a smart solution for health tracking by analyzing user activity data such as steps, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
